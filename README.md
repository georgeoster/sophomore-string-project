ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION:
Email addresses are of the form name@domain.xxx where xxx identifies the domain type. A new online software subscription 
service is free to anyone who is a student or who works for a school or college. Users are considered students if they have
educational email address ending in “.edu”  The person’s user name for the subscription service must be the name part of 
their email address.
Your task is to create a method that will ask for the user’s email address, verify that it is an educational email address, 
then tell the user his or her user name, then ask the user to enter a new password.  If the email address is not an 
educational email address, the program should tell the user this and allow the user to start over or end the program.
